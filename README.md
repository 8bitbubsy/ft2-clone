# ft2-clone
Fasttracker II clone for Windows/macOS/Linux

Aims to be a **highly accurate** clone of the classic Fasttracker II software for MS-DOS. \
The XM player itself has been directly ported from the original source code, for maximum accuracy. \

*What is Fasttracker II? Read about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTracker_2).*

# Releases
Windows/macOS binary releases can always be found at [16-bits.org](https://16-bits.org/ft2.php).

Linux binaries can be found [here](https://repology.org/project/fasttracker2/versions). \
If these don't work for you, you'll have to compile the code manually.

# Compiling the code
Build instructions can be found in the repository (HOW-TO-COMPILE.txt).

Keep in mind that the program may fail to compile on Linux, depending on your distribution and GCC version. \
Please don't nag me about it, and try to use the Linux packages linked to from [16-bits.org](https://16-bits.org/ft2.php) instead.

PS: The source code is quite hackish and hardcoded. \
My first priority is to make an _accurate_ 1:1 clone, and not to make flexible and easily modifiable code.

Big parts of the code (except GUI) are directly ported from the original FT2 source code, with permission to use a BSD 3-Clause license.
