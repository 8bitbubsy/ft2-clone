---- Guide on how to compile the FT2 clone for Windows/macOS/Linux ---
  LINUX NOTE: The program source code is NOT big-endian compatible!

Compiled Windows/macOS binaries are always available at 16-bits.org/ft2.php


== COMPILING ON LINUX ==
 1. Install the following packages:
    Ubuntu/Debian and similar: build-essential libsdl2-dev
    Fedora: gcc gcc-c++ alsa-lib-devel SDL2-devel
    Others: www.google.com (you want gcc, g++ (or c++), alsa dev and SDL2 dev)
 2. Compile the FT2 clone for command line:     (folder: "ft2-clone")
    chmod +x make-linux.sh                      (only needed once)
    ./make-linux.sh
    Compile the FT2 clone as an AppImage:
    chmod +x make-linux-appimage.sh
    ./make-linux-appimage.sh

 Note: If you don't have libstdc++ and/or can't compile rtmidi, try running
       make-linux-nomidi-noflac.sh or make-linux-appimage-nomidi-noflac.sh
       instead.
       
 Known issues: Audio recording (sampling) can update VERY slowly or not work at
               all... I have no idea why, it works really well on Windows/maCOS.

== COMPILING ON WINDOWS 7 SP1 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download Visual Studio Community 2019 (it's free) EDIT: Hard to find now!
 2. Start the installer and select the "Desktop development with C++" package
 3. Install and wait for it to finish...
 4. Open "ft2-clone\vs2019_project\ft2-clone.sln"
 5. If you're missing the Windows 10 SDK, then you need to change the Windows
    SDK version used in the project settings for both debug and release x86/x64.
 6. Compile (make sure it's in Release mode. Also note x86/x64)


== COMPILING ON MAC OS X 10.15 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download and install the "Command Line Tools" XCode package (google it)
 2. Download the SDL 2 framework at https://www.libsdl.org
 3. Inside the package, copy SDL2.framework to /Library/Frameworks/
 4. Compile the FT2 clone:      (folder: "ft2-clone")
    chmod +x make-macos.sh      (only needed once)
   ./make-macos.sh
