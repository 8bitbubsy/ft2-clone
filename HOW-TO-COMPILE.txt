---- Guide on how to compile the FT2 clone for Windows/macOS/Linux ---

LINUX NOTE: This code is NOT big-endian compatible! And converting it would take
            a ton of time, as I fread()/fwrite() directly to/from structs and
            stuff (like original FT2). The structs are also packed, with
            unaligned 16-bit/32-bit entries, so the clone might fail on certain
            CPUs (except x86/x86_64, ARM11 and never). The clone might also
            behave slightly wrong if bitshift-right on signed numbers is
            compiled into using logical shift (LSR/SHR) instead of arithmetic
            shift (ASR/SAR). Most CPUs have ASR/SAR instructions.
              
      
Compiled Windows/macOS binaries are always available at 16-bits.org/ft2.php


== COMPILING ON LINUX (little-endian only!) ==
 1. Install the following packages:
    Ubuntu/Debian and similar: build-essential libsdl2-dev
    Fedora: gcc gcc-c++ alsa-lib-devel SDL2-devel
    Others: www.google.com (you want gcc, g++ (or c++), alsa dev and SDL2 dev)
 2. Compile the FT2 clone:     (folder: "ft2-clone")
    chmod +x make-linux.sh     (only needed once)
    ./make-linux.sh
    
 Note: If you don't have libstdc++ and/or can't compile rtmidi, try running
       make-linux-nomidi.sh instead.
    
 Note: If you want faster audio mixing (for SLOW devices), pass -DLERPMIX
       to the GCC command line (edit make-linux.sh/make-linux-nomidi.sh). This
       will lower the resampling interpolation quality, though...
       
 Known issues: Audio recording (sampling) can update VERY slowly or not work at
               all... I have no idea why, it works really well on Windows/maCOS.

== COMPILING ON WINDOWS 7 SP1 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download Visual Studio Community 2019 (it's free)
 2. Start the installer and select the "Desktop development with C++" package
 3. Install and wait for it to finish...
 4. Open "ft2-clone\vs2019_project\ft2-clone.sln"
 5. If you're missing the Windows 10 SDK, then you need to change the Windows
    SDK version used in the project settings for both debug and release x86/x64.
 6. Compile (make sure it's in Release mode. Also note x86/x64)


== COMPILING ON MAC OS X 10.7 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download and install the "Command Line Tools" XCode package (google it)
 2. Download the SDL 2.0.10 framework here:
    https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.10.dmg
 3. Inside the package, copy SDL2.framework to /Library/Frameworks/
 4. Compile the FT2 clone:     (folder: "ft2-clone"):
    chmod +x make-macos.sh      (only needed once)
   ./make-macos.sh
