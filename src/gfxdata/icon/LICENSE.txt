Someone made this icon for me for free, and I don't really know what license it
has... This icon is only used for the macOS/Windows/Linux release binary, so you
can simply remove it if it causes issue with licensing.

Other than that, I'm fairly sure the creator would be permissive about its use,
so as long as it's not used under commercial circumstances, it should be fine.
