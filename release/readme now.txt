If the program can't start at all, you might need to install
"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019"
which can be found here:

Only install one of them. If you have 64-bit Windows, you need x64, if you have 32-bit, you need x86.

If you can't install it (for whatever reason), or you want a portable installation, you can get the
(many) DLLs needed here: https://16-bits.org/vs2019_crt_dlls.zip
