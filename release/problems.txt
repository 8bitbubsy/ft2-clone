Windows: If the program can't start at all, you might need to install
"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019"
which can be found here:
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

If you have any problems, read Help -> "Problems/FAQ" inside the program.
Also read "Known bugs".

If you selected a big window size by accident and can't go back, press
ALT+ENTER to enter fullscreen, then you go to Config and reset the config.
